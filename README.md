## My Shell
This is a program called myshell which is capable of executing, managing, and monitoring user level programs. This program is similar in purpose and design to everyday shells like bash or tcsh. Myshell is be invoked without any arguments, and will support several different commands. Such comands are...
1. wait command causes the shell to wait for any child process to exit
2. waitfor command does the same thing, but waits for a specific child process to exit
3. run command should combine the behavior of start and waitfor. run should start a program, possibly with command line arguments, wait for that particular process to finish, and print the exit status
4. watchdog takes a timeout (in seconds) and a command to run, and then executes the command in the same way as run
